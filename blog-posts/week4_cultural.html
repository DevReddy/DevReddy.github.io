		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>It is estimated that women currently represent 25% of all science, technology, engineering, and math jobs in the United States, despite them representing almost 47% of the entire workforce, and that of those already in the field, approximately 56% leave the field early in their career. Another estimation claims that the number of women in STEM careers is dropping at a rate of about 0.5% per year. With almost 95% of all jobs today have some degree of a digital component, it is apparent that knowledge of technology is more important than ever, and that we need more women in the field.</p>
		<h3>What To Do?</h3>
		<p>Cindy Bates, one of Microsoft's vice presidents, has stated that we need to do a better job of exposing women to technology related jobs. A recent study showed that 63% of teenage girls asked had never considered a job in technology, stating they'd never felt competent enough. A program called "Aspirations in Computing" was created by the National Center for Women & Information Technology to allow ninth to twelfth grade girls that show any interest in technology to take part in a technology-based program, which is a great start to a solution for this problem. The other problem of women quitting is commonly attributed to an alpha male centric atmoshphere in many workplaces. To combat this would not mean an overnight change, but is affected strongly by these programs that encourage more women to join these fields. Over time with more women joining the tech world this stigma will hopefully dissolve, benefitting not only women but the tech field as a whole.</p>

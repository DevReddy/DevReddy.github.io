		<h3>On Pairing</h3>
		<p>I've personally enjoyed the few pairing experiences I've had so far. Most of my pairs and I have been able to find a good balance between the time when we both step back and research methods on our own and the time we get back together and communicate what we've found to each other. This has been nice because I usually like to take my time thinking through a process on my own to fully understand it, and being able to take these tiny breaks to collect our thoughts has been very beneficial, I believe. <br> The most frustrating parts of my pairing sessions have been the last moments of debugging where we've sat together for upwards of 15 minutes without a clue as to why the code isn't running correctly, but the most rewarding moments have been when we finally realized that we had forgotten to change a variable name or add an extra period. </p>

		<h3>On Feedback</h3>
		<p>I personally find feedback to be harder to give than receive. Looking at some of the more negative bits of feedback can be a little discouraging, but when writing feedback I find myself worrying about if I'm just overanalyzing moments that may or may not have actually been problems worth mentioning in feedback, and I feel rude sometimes mentioning them. I realize from reading my own that it's not feedback to be taken as personally offensive, but to actually reflect on and try to adjust your pairing strategies to work more compatibly with others. <br> From the feedback I've received I plan to work on my communication with my pair when I'm thinking through a process. I tend to say "hold on" and stare at the screen for a second while I think through how something is working, instead of communicating what I'm looking at, what process I'm thinking through, and what I'm looking to figure out. </p>

		<h3>Conclusions</h3>
		<p>Overall, though I still enjoy programming on my own, I think pairing is a valuable tool to solving problems I may not be able to figure out on my own, or to find a new insight to a problem I thought I was already familiar with. Though sometimes I haven't initially wanted to pair at a certain time or on a certain project, I've left each pairing session feeling better than I went in to it.</p>

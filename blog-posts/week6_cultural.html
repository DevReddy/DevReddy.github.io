		<h3>What is Stereotype Threat?</h3>
		<p>"Stereotype Threat" is a theory developed by Dr. Claude M. Steele that says people will subconciously handicap themselves when threatened with being viewed in the context of a negative stereotype or doing something that could inadvertently confirm a stereotype. He states that the concept of social identity, or "group membership" in categories such as age, religion, gender, or ethnicity, can lead to anxiety about being judged stereotypically that can seriously hinder one's performance in many situations, like examinations.</p>
		<p>One of Steele's studies on the theory involved two groups of black and white students who each took the same 30 minute exam made up of questions from the verbal section of the GRE. When one group was told the exam would measure their intellectual capability the black students underperformed by a large amount, while the other group whose test was said could not measure intellectual capability performed all just about equally. Steele attributes this to thoughts of negative, untrue stereotypes about black intelligence being brought to mind in black students when they are explicitly told about a test's ability to measure intelligence.</p>
		<h3>How Do I Feel?</h3>
		<p>Personally, as a middle class white male, I haven't experienced many extreme or notable instances of stereotype threat, though I recognize and try to empathize with the many groups that do suffer these experiences, trying my best to avoid thoughts or actions that might induce these stereotypes. I especially recognize the threat against women in the technology industry and have written about it in the past, with many stereotypes of intelligence and logical reasoning skills being often held against women. With these thoughts in mind it is no wonder that female representation in the field is so low, with a probable good number of women avoiding the field out of intimidation or fear of stereotype threat.</p>
		<p>As Dev Bootcamp seems very accepting of all backgrounds and situations I feel that the threat of stereotype may be smaller here, but that the fact remains that some of the females in the program will undoubtedly feel intimidated or overwhelmed in such a male dominated field. To combat this I try to remain conscious of any gender specific pronouns I may use in every day talk about my work, and I keep an open mind when talking about my work to anybody of any background, be they female or male or of any ethnicity.</p>

		<h3>What are they?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Both Classes and IDs are identifiers we apply to HTML elements, similar to group titles or individual names, that help us refer to specific elements in our CSS file.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>What's the difference?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Classes are like group titles, while IDs are like someone's individual name. Imagine I am an HTML element. There will only ever be one of me in this world (document), and my name (ID) is "Ryan Eddy" (or #ryan_eddy, but we'll cover syntax later).
		<br><br>
		I am also a human, but I am not the ONLY human (thank goodness), so a group (Class) I am part of could be "human" (or .human). I could also have class "male." I am not the only male in the world, but the class does apply to me.
		<br><br>
		A person usually only has one name, but can be a part of many groups throughout their life. This is also the case with HTML elements: they can have up to one ID, but any number of classes (or a combination of both an ID and multiple classes).
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>How do I write these?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Depending on whether you want a class or an ID, simply add it inside the opening tag of the HTML element you'd like to refer to, like so:</p>
		<br>
		<img src="../images/ClassID.png">
		<br><br>
		<p>To refer to a class in CSS, add a "." before the class name, like so:</p>
		<br>
		<img src="../images/Class.png">
		<br><br>
		<p>To refer to an ID, add a "#" before the ID name, like so:</p>
		<br>
		<img src="../images/ID.png">
		<br><br>

		<h3>When should I use one or the other?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>If you want to apply a style to EVERY ONE of a certain element, like every link on the page or every article, you do not need to use either Classes or IDs.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>If you only need to refer to exactly one element, use an ID. For instance, there will usually only be one header on a page, or one footer, so sections like these would be good to apply an ID to (though now with HTML5 you can just use the header or footer tags).</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>If you don't need every one of an element, but you think there's even the TINIEST chance you may need to refer to more than one, you should use a class.</p>

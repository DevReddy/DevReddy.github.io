		<h3>"There is no such thing as a bad question."</h3>
		<p>While I understand that the intent of this statement is to make one comfortable with questioning things, it overlooks an important detail of question asking. You may have a very valid question about something, but if you don't know how to ask about it how ever will you receive the best answer for you?</p>
		<p>To ask the right questions, one strike a balance between presenting all the necessary contextual information and keeping the question as concise and to the point as possible. Not including enough relevant information can leave you frustrated at the number of times you have to rephrase a question before receiving a helpful answer, and including more information than is necessary can cause the person helping to supply you with more information than is necessary or information that is simply not actually relevant to your problem.</p>
		<p>To help with this, one should consider the most relevant keywords to their problem and present that information right away, as simply as can be written. This will help another quickly determine what exactly to focus on when constructing a response and will help to avoid the frustration of miscommunication.</p>
		<p>Lastly, it helps to not assume that your audience is proficient with the material being asked about. This obviously won't always be the case, as if you are asking someone about programming you are probably asking another programmer the question, but assuming the worst case will help you simplify the question to center solely on the real issue and can help you get a relevant answer quicker than it would take if the other person has to think hard about what you are specifically trying to ask.</p>

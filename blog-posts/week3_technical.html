		<h3>Why do we use Javascript?</h3>
		<p>Javascript is very popular in web development for a large number of reasons, but a few prominent reasons include these:</p>
		<h2>(Relatively) Easy to Learn!</h2>
		<p>While I'm not saying Javascript is super easy to learn, it seems easier to pick up than some other more complex languages because it is similar to so many popular languages already and it is also easier to read and interpret for humans than many others.</p>
		<h2>All the Libraries!</h2>
		<p>Not only are there a huge amount of resources already on the web dedicated to Javascript, but "libraries," also often called frameworks, have been developed to facilitate implementing more advanced Javascript code without having to develop what has already been done before. This is a great thing for people who enjoy free time.</p>
		<h2>It's FAST!</h2>
		<p>Javascript is run on the "client side" instead of the server side (thanks to Node.js!), meaning there is less of a load on the server. </p>

		<h3>Alright, what's the catch?</h3>
		<p>While all that is awesome, having it run on the client's side does open up an increased risk of exploitation and vulnerability for the server. Javascript may also run into compatibility issues across different browsers, as not all browsers support it in the same way, so development for multiple browsers may be necessary. </p>

		<p>I feel that the DBC experience is going to be both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding. I'm actually very intimidated by the idea of going into this environment, with feelings ranging from "I'm not creative enough!" to "Everybody has had more experience than me," but I'm also excited by the idea that I'll be pushing myself harder than I honestly think I ever have before. My expectations of DBC have changed in the sense that now instead of being scared that it will kick my ass and I'll be constantly embarrased by what I don't know at the time, I am now POSITIVE that it will kick my ass and I will be constantly embarrased and humbled - but that that is actually going to be a benefit in the end! </p><br>
		<p>My expectations have also changed by what Shereef said about it being more about the journey, and not the destination- he pointed out a lot of mentalities I find myself slipping into occasionally and I am glad to have the opportunity to recognize them and try to change them. It was nice to hear that I am not the only one with these fears and anticipations, and I believe that the musical instrument metaphor put into good words some of my fears of not being able to be creative enough right away. </p><br>
		<p>I'm very excited to participate in such an environment and hope to take away as much from DBC as is possible for me, and though it will be way outside my usual comfort zone I believe it will be a good thing in the end . It does make me very nervous, but I think (hope) that means I'm considering these things seriously.</p><br>

		<h3>First, what does "enumerable" mean?</h3>
		<p>In Ruby, classes that are a collection of data, such as an array or hash, are said to be enumerable because their data is able to be "placed into a one-to-one relationship with the set of all positive integers." Basically, you can count them or perform methods that look at "each" of them. </p>
		<p>"Enumerable" itself in Ruby is a module that contains many methods you can use to traverse your collection of data and do things to each of its values. In other words, you're going to learn to love using these methods.</p>
		<h3>Sweet! So what does #map do?</h3>
		<p><code>Enumerable#map</code> can be called by writing <code>Thing.map { |object| action }</code></p>
		<p>This will perform the action on each object in "Thing," our data collection, and return the results as a new array. For instance, </p>
		<code>Array = [ 1, 2, 3 ] <br> Array.map { |i| i*2 }</code>
		<p>would multiply each element in Array by 2, then return</p>
		<code>=> [ 2, 4, 6 ]</code>
		<h3>#collect is the same thing, right? Why do we need it?</h3>
		<p>It is EXACTLY the same thing! No need to stress over it! Many other programming languages have similar functions to #map: C++ has #transform, C# has #select, and Smalltalk has #collect. Essentially, Ruby only includes #collect to give programmers from other languages more options, and to possibly help them feel more at home while coding.</p>

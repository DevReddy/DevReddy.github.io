		<h3>Happy L<a class = "egg" href="http://i.imgur.com/0IxtIRs.jpg">i</a>ttle Values</h3>
		<p>When I think of times in my life I've felt the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied, the following values are some that come to mind:</p>
		<p>Accomplishment Achievement Adventure Challenge Competence Creativity  Effectiveness Efficiency Freedom Friendships Growth Independence Inner harmony Insight Inspiration Integrity Introspection Knowledge Meaningful work Music Nature Openness Personal development Pleasure Privacy Quality Security Self-knowledge Stability Truth Vibrancy Wisdom</p>
		<p>Of the chosen values, I think personal development is one of the most important to me. I've always loved to learn new things, but I recognize the value of personal reflection and the need for both for personal development to work.</p>
		<h3>Rating the Rest</h3>
		<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
			Disagree 1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4 --- 5 Agree<br>
			Accomplishment - 3<br>Achievement - 4<br>Adventure - 4<br>Challenge - 4<br>Competence - 4<br>Creativity - 5<br>Effectiveness - 4<br>Efficiency - 4<br>Freedom - 3<br>Friendships - 3<br>Growth - 3<br>Independence - 3<br>Inner harmony - 2<br>Insight - 3<br>Inspiration - 4<br>Integrity - 4<br>Introspection - 4<br>Knowledge - 4<br>Meaningful work - 3<br>Music - 4<br>Nature - 2<br>Openness - 3<br>Personal development - 5<br>Pleasure - 4<br>Privacy - 3<br>Quality - 4<br>Security - 4<br>Self-knowledge - 4<br>Stability - 3<br>Truth - 3<br>Vibrancy - 3<br>Wisdom - 4</p>
		<h3>My Advice, and Stereotype Threat</h3>
		<p>The last topic someone asked for my advice on was strategy for drafting a set of Magic: the Gathering with friends. I feel this somewhat reflects some of my values such as enjoying a challenge, being creative, and my search for effectiveness and efficiency. I personally get excited when faced with an exciting or interesting challenge, but I recognize that not everyone has the same values as me and may not enjoy the game in the same way I do so I try to take a neutral stance as I explain the various options the game has.<br>
			I think to be able to recognize others' values can help you mediate stereotype threat by helping realize why you might feel a certain way toward someone, be aware of how you wish to react to that, and how you wish to then mindfully interact with them.</p>
			<h3>The Happiest Little Values</h3>
			<p>If for whatever reason I'm feeling down at DBC, I think I'll try to focus on a value of mine that would make me happy to focus on and try to achieve something supporting that value. Learning even a tiny bit toward starting a new skill or hobby can be very rewarding.</p>

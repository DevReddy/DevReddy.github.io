		<h1>My Three Favorite Sites</h1>
	</div>
	
	<section id="content">
		<h3>Site 1: <a class="link" href="http://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">Soundcloud.com</a></h3>
		<img src="../images/soundcloud.jpg" alt="Soundcloud.com main page" height="300" width="500">
		<p>
			Soundcloud is one of my favorite sites because I fall into the category of people that "can't live without music." Soundcloud allows users to host their audio files (mostly, but not limited to, music), and allows listeners to listen to and download songs while following their favorite artists, all in a very simple and easy to navigate manner. </p>
		<p>
			The eye is drawn to the large audio waves of the files listed down the page, both from up close and afar. This is arguably the most important area of the site, as for the majority of users (listeners) navigation through the site will stay on or revert back to the long scrolling front page. Visually, I would describe the website as minimal, elegant, pleasing, organized, and bright. </p>
		<p>
			Five adjectives I would use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site are fun, audial, serious, easy (to use and navigate), and practical. I say both fun and serious because while any audio can be hosted, the majority of users use it either to host or listen to music and while music can be very fun, many artists take it seriously. Soundcloud is meant to be very easy to use for either hoster or listener, and I'd say these adjectives go very well with its visual adjectives. It is very easy to find an artist or a song from the main page, and just as easy to navigate between the main page, artist's pages, or sound pages. Any current playing song will continue to play regardless of which page you are on, and to return to the song is as easy as clicking the name of the current song in the top right. </p>
		<p>
			After being on the site for a while I usually feel very happy, having found new music by artists I like or having just listened to some of my favorites. As I'm definitely an audiophile, I almost never feel like I've wasted time on the site and it actually helps relieve stress. </p>
		<p>
			The only thing the site sells directly is a "Pro" membership that allows a user to host more content on the site. Indirectly, the site links to external sites where you can purchase an artist's music. I have never purchased the membership because I personally do not host enough music to require extra time, but I have purchased music found on Soundcloud by clicking the reference links for an artist. </p>
		<br>

		<h3>Site 2: <a class="link" href="http://twitch.tv" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a></h3>
		<img src="../images/Twitch.jpg" alt="Twitch.tv main page" height="300" width="500">
		<p>

			Twitch is one of my favorite sites because it allows people to stream themselves playing a game and have people watch them live over the internet, whether they'd like to watch a pro play and pick up techniques or they simply don't own the game and would like to see gameplay before purchase. A streamer can also upload clips of recent streams as VODs (Videos on Demand) for users to watch when the streamer is offline.</p>
		<p>
			When looking at the homepage, regardless of distance, the eye is immediately drawn to the video taking up most of the screen playing the stream of a currently supported streamer. This area is important for those interested in the game currently being played or the streamer themself (for increased traffic), but to users not interested in the game it is not the most important part. </p>
		<p>
			Finding what you want from the main page is very easy, as a user need only scroll down to see a list of games being played at the moment, or type a game or streamer name into the search bar at the top of the page. From any other page it is as easy as clicking "Search" or "Browse Games" in the sidebar. The sidebar is very intuitive and moving through pages on the site is facilitated a lot by it. </p>
		<p>
			Visually, I would describe the site as organized, simple, geometric, bright, and pleasing. In terms of the content, focus, and purpose of the site I would describe it as fun, educational, economical, serious, and recreational. The site itself not only tries to make it easier on viewers to find content, but also tries to support the streamers as much as possible and direct more traffic to their pages so they can make money. In this sense, I feel that both sets of adjectives match well with the site's goals. </p>
		<p>
			After being on the site for a long while, depending on what I'm watching, I usually either feel happy and refreshed or bored and like I wasted time. Due to the large number of different games to play and the diversity in streamer quality, it is hard to say for certain when I log on whether I will end up watching a good stream or a relatively uneventful one. </p>
		<p>
			The site does not sell any materials, but allows users to support a streamer by purchasing a subscription to their channel for five dollars. I have not yet purchased a subscription to a channel because I am not on the site often enough to warrant one, but I have considered it as there are at least two streamers that I enjoy watching a lot and feel deserve the extra fnancial support.</p>

		<h3>Site 3: <a class="link" href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a></h3>
		<img src="../images/reddit.jpg" alt="Reddit.com main page" height="300" width="500">
		<p>
			Reddit is one of my favorite sites because it allows a user to browse all kinds of different content in a way they can customize themselves. The site istelf is divided into a seemingly endless number of "subreddits," which are sections of the site specifically designated to one type of content. Users can follow multiple subreddits and have submissions appear from each on the front page of the site, or they can go into one subreddit and browse submissions of only the one type. </p>
		<p>
			Up close, the eye is drawn to the long list of links to content on the front page, which is essentially the most important part of the site for users aside from the buttons at top designating subreddit choice. When far away, the eye is either drawn to the links or to the large ad on the right side of the page, which technically might be one of the most important parts for the developers. </p>
		<p>
			Visually, I would describe the site as bright, simple, cluttered, full, and inclusive.In terms of content, focus, and purpose, I would describe the site as open, serious, fun, educational, and practical. Because the site has almost any type of content you could imagine hosted on it, it is very open to how each individual user tailors their own experience. The main page admittedly seems fairly cluttered at first glance, but after familiarizing yourself with the site it is very inclusive in how many links you can fit on one page, which comes in handy with the amount of content usually viewed in one sitting, so while cluttered might not always be a nice adjective I think it goes well with the content adjectives of the site in general. </p>
		<p>
			An advanced search option makes finding specific content much easier than scrolling through endless pages, as there is almost guaranteed to be multiple pages of content relevant to your search. From the homepage it is fairly easy to find relevant content, as you can either search for it, go to a relevant subreddit, or if you've already subscribed to the subreddit, you can look for it on the main page. From another page it is almost exactly the same process as from the homepage, but you will not see content from multiple subreddits all at once. </p>
		<p>
			Browsing through the content on the site is almost too easy, to the point where I will sometimes catch myself hours into reading many random articles or looking at different pictures and realize just how much time I've wasted. After browsing the site for long, depending on if I'm reading educational content or just looking at funny stuff, I can feel energized and knowledgable or like I just wasted so many hours and like I'm the laziest person in the world. </p>
		<p> 
			The site does not sell anything itself, but has ads, promotional accounts, and sponsored item exchanges every so often.

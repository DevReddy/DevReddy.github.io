		<h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
		<p>I believe my thinking style falls mostly into the "Concrete Random" category. I think some positives from this are that I'm a natural experimenter and an interested troubleshooter, I usually try to make sense of "the bigger picture" of a system and like to reverse engineer things, and I can take in and compartmentalize information well.</p>
		<br>
		<p>One of my biggest challenges so far with Phase 0, and a con of my thinking style, is that I definitely have a huge number of hobbies and projects going on, but have trouble finishing much of them. On top of this, I think I definitely jump too eagerly sometimes into avoidance under stress which can lead me to jump to a random hobby instead of address an issue. </p>
		<br>
		<p>To combat this, and to broaden the way I think and learn, I am working more on prioritizing activities and managing time more efficiently to allow myself to indulge in my hobbies, but to make sure I am not avoiding issues that will later weigh on me and hinder any other progress. I am also focusing more on being mindful throughout the day so I can be more aware of when stress makes me slip into avoiding an issue, and reflect on it before I consciously decide how to act on those feelings. I hope that through these actions I will be in my "flow" mindset more frequently and allow me to be more productive than I am being at the moment.</p>

		<p>My most recent emotional conflict evolved from me underestimating my ability to learn and finish a week's worth of DBC work by the weekend, causing me to be stressed all week about how I could ever get the work done. Because of this, I ended up procrastinating larger pieces of work that intimidated me while focusing on random other hobbies to destress. This culminated at the week's end with me stressing more than necessary about my work, causing tension between my girlfriend and I.</p>
		<p>My actions definitely made the situation worse, and if I could go back I would not repeat any of them. After completing the work I felt great about myself and realized how early in the week I could have been done if I hadn't overworried myself and procrastinated out of intimidation and stress. The next week I took these thoughts into consideration and I managed to complete all necessary work by Wednesday, which not only felt amazing but allowed me to catch up on extra work and help others toward the end of the week who were still struggling. </p>

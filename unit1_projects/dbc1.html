	<h1>Who is this kid?</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm <span id=”bluefont”>Ryan Eddy</span>. I'm an aspiring web developer, musician, and game designer! <img src="https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xpa1/t1.0-1/p200x200/10367731_10152067419417001_4048631965436145443_n.jpg" alt="Hey, it's me! (On the right)" width="100" height="100"> Here's a link to my email: <a href="mailto:RyanEddyDev@gmail.com">Send me mail!</a></p>

	<h2>Web developer? Really?</h2>
	<p>Hey, I said aspiring. The site is just basic HTML, <a href="http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/build-a-bridge-and-get-over-it-20.png">get over it.</a> It'll get better in time.</p>

	<h3>Musician as well?</h3>
	<p>Well, not yet. Those listed are all <strong>aspirations</strong>. I hope to start learning music theory in the near future, but currently when I'm not working I just sit around and play games with friends.</p>

	<h4>What kind of games?</h4>
	<p>All kinds! For video games, I play mostly games on Steam. My top played games are:
	<ol class="list">
  		<li>Counter Strike</li>
  		<li>Civilization V</li>
  		<li>The Binding of Isaac</li>
	</ol>
	 Outside of video games, I play :
	<ul class="list">
 		<li>Magic: the Gathering</li>
  		<li>Settlers of Catan</li>
  		<li>Arkham Horror</li>
  		<li>Last Night on Earth</li>
	</ul>
	and every once in a while I play Dungeons and Dragons, if I can find a group.
	  <br>Here's a link to my Steam profile: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/xactoknife"><img src="http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/6b/6bd3989a3acc76465811701b1eabe56485304196_full.jpg" alt="BMO, P.I."></a>
	  Also, if you don't already have Steam, go install it! <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam!!!</a>
	</p>

	<h5>Well, what ab- hey, these headers are getting smaller!</h5>
	<p>I was required to use six header sizes! Not my fault!</p>

	<h6>What!? But <em>THIS</em> is the sixth! Oh no! Will I ever hear from you again, Ryan?</h6>
	<p>Hopefully one day, when I create a prettier site and I once more have need of a disembodied voice to ask me questions. It's been great talking though, see you then!</p>
